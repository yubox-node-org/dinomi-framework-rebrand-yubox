Description:  Dinomi First Boot Setup
 This module contains (or should contain) utilities and configurations that
 cannot be prepared at install time from the ISO image, and are therefore
 delayed until the first boot of the newly installed system. The main aim of
 this script is to replace elastix-mysqldbdata until all RPMS are able to
 either prepare their databases on their own, or delegate this task to this
 package.
